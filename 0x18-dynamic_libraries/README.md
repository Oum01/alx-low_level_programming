## Introduction

Dynamic libraries, also known as shared libraries, are a way to package reusable code that can be loaded and linked at runtime by programs. They provide a modular approach to software development, allowing developers to distribute and update libraries independently of the applications that use them.

This project explores the concepts and usage of dynamic libraries in C programming. It covers creating and using dynamic libraries, dynamic linking, and dynamic loading.

## Installation

To use the code in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/0x18-dynamic_libraries.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd 0x18-dynamic_libraries
```

3. Compile the source code files using the provided `Makefile`:

```bash
make all
```

This will compile the source code and generate the necessary dynamic library files.
